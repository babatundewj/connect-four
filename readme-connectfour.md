***Connect Four Documentation***

Welcome to the Connect Four game 1.0!

This game requires two players. Red moves first, and black moves second.

Simply click anywhere on your column where you would like your chip to go. The first person to connect four slots vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the match!

**WARNING! Do not click on the yellow piece; you will forfeit your turn and it goes to the next person. The yellow board is LAVA (actually it's a bug but lava sounds cooler and resonates better)
